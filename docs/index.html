    <h2>Sport Climbing Maps</h2>

    <p>
      Right in the middle of Brisbane you can find the Kangaroo Point Cliffs. 
      In amongst the runners, exercise groups and midnight strollers there's also a bunch of climbing. 
      The main sources of information about the routes here are the website <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/kangaroo-point">The Crag</a> and the South East Queensland guidebook. 
      These are great, but I found myself wanting something a little less verbose, just listing the climbs, grades and protection required.  
      Something concise and ultra convenient. 
      I couldn't find exactly what I was looking for so set out to create it myself.

      My map shows one section of the main wall on each page, detailing the climbs like in the picture below. 
      The routes are drawn in approximately the right locations with bolts and anchors marked. 
      Above the routes are the names and grades while below shows the lightboxes and graffiti to help you navigate.

      There is also a table of all the routes which can be used as a tick-list.

      I've only included what look to be the most accessible sports climbing routes at Kangaroo Point.
      Go to <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/kangaroo-point">The Crag</a> to find out about trad and mixed routes.
      Of course, it's possible to set up a top rope essentially anywhere on the cliffs so you can also just play around and see what's possible.

      I made these maps because I wanted them for my own use.
      Now that that's done, I'm happy to give them away in the hope that others find it helpful.
      I'm sure it goes without saying that I'd prefer you to send people to this site instead of sharing the file directly. 
      If you appreciate the maps you can always buy me a beer in thanks!
